# Accentuize

Accentuize is a tool that allows a user to hear words pronounced in different accents.

First, the user enters an English word, and the app will return a normalized phonetic transcription
taken from a dictionary API. Then it transforms that transcription by replacing certain sounds
according to the accent that the user has chosen (currently General American, Northern Inland, or Southern).

Finally, the user can send that transcription to Amazon's Polly text-to-speech service, and hear the word
spoken aloud in the chosen accent.

Built independently during a four-day hackathon.
